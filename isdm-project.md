### **Assumptions**

* The following project started from 1st January 2020.
* For every RM, there is one customer served at a time. 
* For every RM. there is one RM profile created for them. 
* The RM can be disconnected in a call at any time, either intentionally or unintentionally by the customer.        
* The customer will be calling the travel company for either: enquiries about existing products or interest in purchasing an existing product
* The customer cannot ask for a specific RM to serve them, as the customer will be directed to the first available RM that will meet their needs or enquiries.
* The customer has the option to purchase the product online or in-store, assuming that the travel company has a website and a physical store.
* There is an increase of customers during the holiday season, especially during school holidays.
