#### 1. Project Objectives
##### Our objective is to create an improved simplified system that improves the operation of their inhouse call management system. We aim to do complete this objective through the following:  

* Provide suggestions as to how the company can improve their operations
* Define the problem from a design thinking perspective
* List the overall assumptions of the system 
* Document our proposed solutions including any Information System models and work products
* Create any needed diagrams that can be used to help explain, promote and visualise the new business system. 
* Discuss advantages and disadvantages of improving the overall system as well as the failures that are associated with this. 

##### We hope, by the end of the project, the company will be able to achieve the following: 

* System will be used by Relationship Managers to sell holiday packages to potential customers.
* Improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for inbound and outbound calls.
* Improved accuracy when matching a customer to a RM that suits the customer’s needs.

### **Approach from a Design Thinking Perspective**
#####  Our approach to solve the problem that the travel company is experiencing will be shaped by the five stages of design thinking. Our first stage will consist of creating empathy maps in order to better understand the POV of our various stakeholders. These empathy maps will allow us to understand the problem as a whole as well as any concerns, questions and feelings our stakeholders have about this project. Using these empathy maps will enable us to create a problem statement which will summarise the problem that the company is experiencing. During the design phase, we aim to brainstorm a list of methods that will help solve the company problem through the Agile Scrum Methodology, the Ideate and Prototype phase will consist of creating a variety of business diagrams such as the Collaboration, Sequence and Use Case Diagrams which will help us visualise to the stakeholder our interpretation of their requirements. This will also allow the stakeholder to give any feedback to us about the requirement. Finally, the test phase will consist of testing the product in order to ensure that it meets the stakeholder’s expectation and that it will be successful. 

### **Agile Methodology**
##### The Scrum framework we have used to carry out this procedure follows the values and principles of Agile methodology.  The Scrum team consists of three roles including a Product Owner, who is a single person allowing for faster decision making, Scrum Master, who is responsible for ensuring the Scrum framework and Agile methodology is enacted and a Development Team, who is responsible for building a potentially releasable product at the end of each Sprint.  The Sprints are two weeks long allowing for faster feedback and more opportunities to improve on design, coding, testing, and documentation.  Each Sprint starts with Sprint Planning to define a goal of the sprint and each Sprint ends with a Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective, to examine what has been made, what worked well, what didn’t work well and ways to improve in the next increment.   Scrum Artifacts used in this project include the product backlog, which consists of User Stories that outline the requirements for the system and product, and Sprint Backlog, which consists of a specific list of items taken from the product backlog to be completed in a sprint.

### **Assumptions**

* The following project started from 1st January 2020.
* For every RM, there is one customer served at a time. 
* For every RM. there is one RM profile created for them. 
* The RM can be disconnected in a call at any time, either intentionally or unintentionally by the customer.        
* The customer will be calling the travel company for either: enquiries about existing products or interest in purchasing an existing product
* The customer cannot ask for a specific RM to serve them, as the customer will be directed to the first available RM that will meet their needs or enquiries.
* The customer has the option to purchase the product online or in-store, assuming that the travel company has a website and a physical store.
* There is an increase of customers during the holiday season, especially during school holidays.
